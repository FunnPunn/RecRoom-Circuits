Do not try enabling this circuit before whitelisting yourself or the room owners, as this will softlock the room

This circuit has 3 really important uses:
  Preventing hackers from spawning or deleting items in your game via makerpen
  Preventing hackers from giving players Room Currency, Room Keys, or Consumables with Award Currency, Award Room Key, and Award     Consumable, scamming you, the room owner, out of money
  Preventing hackers from setting the variables of themselves or other players to insanely high or insanely low values which can only be reset manually or by resetting everyone's variables, which is really unfair for people who got their score legitimately

The circuit is as follows
