# Making a background music player
In this guide, we will teach you how to make a playlist in RecRoom!

:::note

These guides assume that you know how to navigate menus, wire chips, ect.
If this is not the case, please look up another tutorial.

:::

First we want to spawn a [List Create](/docs/Chips/542d3256-0d51-4c33-a2a1-fbc44b7e1f07) and a few [Audio Samples](/docs/Chips/2cb45825-f385-414f-9a65-2425963fa720). Wire the sounds to the [List Create](/docs/Chips/542d3256-0d51-4c33-a2a1-fbc44b7e1f07).

:::tip

Configure the [List Create](/docs/Chips/542d3256-0d51-4c33-a2a1-fbc44b7e1f07) to add inputs so you can wire more samples!

Next, we want to spawn in an [Event Receiver](/docs/Chips/8b533ccb-643a-491d-982c-94417ce99954). Once spawned in, configure it, and select `Player Joined`.

Next, spawn in an [If Local Player Should Run](/docs/Chips/6d69bee8-0d77-4d5f-bf35-9794eaaabe81). Wire it like so.

Next, spawn in a [Random From List](/docs/Chips/d253cef6-dd99-4357-b98a-e09a0c23bad7) Chip. Wire it like so.

Next, spawn in an `Audio Player`. Configure it and scroll down to Synced.

Make sure it is toggled off. Next, spawn in a delay chip, and wire the rest like so

Now when a player joins the room, there is a playlist of audio playing in the background.
