# Making a PVP health system
:::note

These guides assume that you know how to navigate menus, wire chips, ect.
If this is not the case, please look up another tutorial.

:::

First you will need a [Player Definition Board](/docs/chips/4c9e7840-0721-4d1c-b334-167f79d3bf40).

Next, you will need to edit into the board and add the following chips:
1. [int Variable](/docs/chips/33224907-68ff-4102-802e-7c3eed481d37)
1. [Event Receiver](/docs/chips/8b533ccb-643a-491d-982c-94417ce99954)
1. [Subtract](/docs/chips/1fbb364c-1af0-44bb-a82b-905caeb6819a)

We will be using the `Projectile Hit Player` event to register when the player is hit. This is a built-in event.

Next, configure the [Event Receiver's](/docs/chips/8b533ccb-643a-491d-982c-94417ce99954) event to `Projectile Hit Player`.

<GuideMedia fileName="6IH4e3j.png" fileType="image" />

Configure the [int Variable](/docs/chips/33224907-68ff-4102-802e-7c3eed481d37) and rename it to `Health`, hit submit and set the value to whatever you want (this should be the max health).
You can change the name to something else, but to make it clear that it's a health variable, we will be using `Health`.

Next, we will take away health every time the player is hit.
To do this, first wire the Circuits as shown below:

<GuideMedia fileName="q7bybgD.png" fileType="image" />

Then wire the `Exec` ports as so:

<GuideMedia fileName="cIqCEIp.png" fileType="image" />

Now every time you hit a player with a projectile, it will deal the appropriate amount of damage.
:::tip
You can add [math](/docs/tags/math) chips to modify the damage coming in!

Now let's make it so the players die when they reach 0 health.

Add a [Less or Equal](/docs/chips/a027073f-9189-457f-a53d-8562e8829daf) and an [If](/docs/chips/7adc6ab1-fcab-4746-aec6-006352e29cdc) chip
and wire it like so:

<GuideMedia fileName="R8Zjxpz.png" fileType="image" />

Next, add a [Respawn Point Respawn Player](/docs/chips/350cda38-d7c5-4319-bb15-a06f49bbb0b9) chip and wire the `then` output of the [If](/docs/chips/7adc6ab1-fcab-4746-aec6-006352e29cdc) to the [Respawn Point Respawn Player](/docs/chips/350cda38-d7c5-4319-bb15-a06f49bbb0b9) input.

<GuideMedia fileName="n52PZpm.png" fileType="image" />

Now back over here, add a [Self](/docs/Chips/3d7d40d6-885a-4fa5-bbaa-b19057291ddb) chip

<GuideMedia fileName="bwpqaWT.png" fileType="image" />

Now wire the [Self](/docs/chips/3d7d40d6-885a-4fa5-bbaa-b19057291ddb) output to the Player port on the [Respawn Point Respawn Player](/docs/chips/350cda38-d7c5-4319-bb15-a06f49bbb0b9) chip.

Now to reset the player heath, clone the health variable we created earlier and set the input port to 100 (or your desired max health).
:::info
Variables with the same name **and** datatype will sync with each other.
:::
Then, drag the variable next to the [Respawn Point Respawn Player](/docs/chips/350cda38-d7c5-4319-bb15-a06f49bbb0b9)


Now wire the `Exec` port on the [Respawn Point Respawn Player](/docs/chips/350cda38-d7c5-4319-bb15-a06f49bbb0b9) to the health variable input.
Now when your health gets to 0, you respawn!
The Circuits should look similar to this:

Congrats! You made a PVP health system!

A guide on how to use the [Player World UI Constant](/docs/chips/ff2d1f81-d76c-456f-acf0-af1861822681) will come soon.
This will be useful for displaying the player's health!
