title: 'Player Set Force VR Walk'
---

Forces the given player to use walk rather than teleport mode if they are playing in VR. This is useful when you need access to their walk inputs which won't fire if they are in teleport mode. You should consider adding a warning to your room so teleport players are aware that you're going to change their movement mode.

:::caution BETA

This chip requires beta content to be enabled in the room. You can access the setting in "This Room -> Settings".
