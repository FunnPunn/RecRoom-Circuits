## Tips

Docusaurus works with markdown files, but it also has a few plugins.
This means that you can create note, tip, info, danger and caution boxes to display meaningful notes.

```md
:::note

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::danger

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

:::

:::tip

Some **content** with _Markdown_ `syntax`. Check [this `api`](#).

```

You can also test the new pages by going to `Circuits` and running `npm run start -- --host 0.0.0.0`. (after installing the `docusaurus` module, of course).
